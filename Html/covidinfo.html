            From flights during COVID-19 to government mandates required for travel, get information about all your travel-related queries here.
            If your destination city/state mandates a negative RT-PCR report, then you must carry the same to be allowed boarding from your origin station.
            it is compulsory to wear a mask at all times throughout your journey, be it at the airport or inside the flight. It helps you, your fellow passengers and us stay safe.
            From deeply disinfecting the lean, clean flying machine to minimising contact and regularly sanitising every touchpoint of your journey, our staff ensures flying with us is as safe and hassle-free as possible for you
            Customers are also requested to familiarise themselves with the guidelines for air passengers published by the Indian Ministry of Civil Aviation on the following link:<br>
            <br><br><a href="https://www.civilaviation.gov.in/sites/default/files/Guidelines_for_Air_Passengers_21May.pdf">https://www.civilaviation.gov.in/sites/default/files/Guidelines_for_Air_Passengers_21May.pdf</a>
